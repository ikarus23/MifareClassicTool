  <h2 id="general_information">1. General Information</h2>
    This tool provides several features to interact with (and only with)
    Mifare Classic RFID-Tags. It is designed for users who have at least
    basic familiarity with the Mifare Classic technology.
    You also need an understanding of the hexadecimal number system,
    because all data input and output is in hexadecimal.
    <br /><br />
    Some important things are:
    <ul>
      <li>The features this tool provides are very basic. There are no such
        fancy things like saving a URL to an RFID-Tag with a nice looking
        graphical user interface. If you want so save things on a tag,
        you have to input the raw hexadecimal data.
      </li>
      <li>This App <b>can not crack/hack</b>
        any Mifare Classic keys. If you want to read/write an RFID-Tag, you
        first need keys for this specific tag. For additional information
        please read/see chapter
        <a href="#getting_started">Getting Started</a>.
      </li>
      <li>There will be <b>no &quot;brute-force&quot; attack</b>
        capability in this application. It is way too slow due
        to the protocol.
      </li>
      <li>This app will <b>not</b> work on the following devices because
        their hardware (NFC-controller) does not support Mifare Classic
        (<a href="https://github.com/ikarus23/MifareClassicTool/issues/1">read

  <h2 id="getting_started">2. Getting Started</h2>
    First of all, you need the keys for the tag you want to read.
    Due to some weaknesses in Mifare Classic, you can retrieve
    all the keys (A and B) of a tag with tools like the
    <a href="http://www.proxmark.org/">Proxmark3</a> or
    normal RFID-Readers and some special software
    (<a href="https://code.google.com/p/mfcuk/">mfcuk</a>,
    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mfoc/">mfoc</a>).
    <br /><br />
    The application comes with standard key files called
    <i>std.keys</i> and <i>extended-std.keys</i>, which contains the
    well known keys and some standard keys from a short Google search.
    You can try to read a tag with this key file using
    &quot;Read Tag&quot; from main menu.
    <br /><br />
    Once you know some keys, you cam to put them into a simple text
    file (one key per line). You can do this on your PC and transfer
    the file to the <i>MifareClassicTool/key-files/</i>
    directory (on external storage), or you can create a new key file via
    &quot;Edit or Add Key File&quot; from main menu.
    If you are finished setting up your key file, you can read a tag
    using &quot;Read Tag&quot; from main menu.
    <br /><br />
    <b>Advantages of the Key Files Concept:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>You don't have to worry about which key is for which
        sector.</b><br />
        The application tries to authenticate with all keys from the key
        file against all sectors (like a dictionary-attack).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>You don't have to know all the keys.</b><br />
        If neither key A nor key B for a specific sector is found in the
        key file (dictionary), the application will skip reading said
        sector.
      </li>
    </ul>
    This dictionary-attack based mapping process
    (keys &lt;-&gt; sectors) makes it easy for you to read as much as
    possible with the keys you know!
  <hr />


  <h2 id="read_tag">3. Read Tag</h2>
    Technically speaking, reading an RFID-Tag is done in two steps:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>Choose a key file</i><br />
        Press &quot;Read Tag&quot; in the main menu. Now select
        key files which (perhaps) contain the keys for the tag.
        You can also specify the range of sectors you want to read.
        Start the mapping process with the lower right button.<br />
        But: For large key files this could take quite some time!
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Read tag</i><br />
        After the keys are mapped to sectors based on a kind of
        dictionary-attack, the application will instantly start
        to read the tag. The result will be displayed in a
        simple editor (See chapter
        <a href="#edit_dump_file">Edit Tag Dump File</a>.)
      </li>
    </ul>
  <hr />


  <h2 id="write_tag">4. Write Tag</h2>
    If you want to write data to a Mifare Classic tag, it is important
    that you understand what you are doing. Writing the wrong data
    to certain blocks may cause irreparable damage to the tag.

  <h3 id="write_block">4.1 Write Block</h3>
    First you have to specify to which block you want to write to.
    Typical (Mifare Classic 1k) ranges are: sector 0-15, block 0-3.
    The second step is to enter the data you want to write. This is
    done in hexadecimal format with a length of 16 bytes (32 characters).
    After pressing the button, the last step is to chose key files
    which (possibly) contain the key with privilege to write for this
    sector/block.

  <h3 id="write_dump">4.2 Write Dump (Clone)</h3>
    With this method you can write a dump (or some sectors of it) to a tag.
    If you want to clone a tag, you first have to read and then dump
    the original tag. The second step is to restore the dumped data on another
    tag (for which you know the keys). You need the keys with write privileges
    for all sectors you want to write.<br />
    After selecting the dump, the sectors and the key files, the App will check
    everything for you! If there are issues like 'block is read-only', 'key
    with write access not known', etc., you will get a report before writing.
    <br /><br />
    <b>Options:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>Use static (custom) Access Conditions</i><br />
        By enabling this option, all Access Conditions from the dump
        will be replaced with the chosen ones.
        <br />This is useful if the dump contains Access Conditions
        that will be permanent for a tag. In case the reader does not check
        them, you can easily use custom ones to make the tag reusable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Write to Manufacturer Block</i><br />
        The first block of the first sector of an <b>original</b>
        Mifare Classic tag is <u>read-only</u> i.e. not writable. But there are
        <b>special</b> Mifare Classic tags that support writing to the
        manufacturer block with a simple write command. This App is able to
        write to such tags and can therefore create fully correct clones.
        <br />However, some special tags require a special command sequence to
        put them into the state where writing to the manufacturer block is
        possible. These tags will not work.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h3 id="factory_format">4.3 Factory Format</h3>
    This will try to format the tag back to factory/delivery state. In this
    state, all data block bytes are 0x00 and the sector trailers contain
    0xFFFFFFFFFFFF as key A/B and 0xFF078000 as access conditions.

  <h3 id="write_value_block">4.4 Incr./Decr. Value Block</h3>
    With this method you can increment or decrement and than transfer a Value Block.
    If an increment or decrement fails, it is due to one of the following reasons:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The selected target block is not a Value Block.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Access Conditions don't allow to increment or decrement the
        Value Block.
      </li>
      <li>
        The provided value is incorrect. This happens if you try to increment
        a Value Block to a value above the upper limit (2,147,483,647) or if
        you try to decrement it to a value under the lower limit
        (-2,147,483,648).
      </li>
    </ul>
    If a increment or decrement fails due to an interrupted and therefore
    incomplete transaction, the Value Block could become unusable.<br /></br>

    If you don't know what a Mifare Classic Value Block is, you should read
    chapter 8.6.2.1 of the
    <a href="http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/MF1S50YYX.pdf">
    Mifare Classic (1k) Datasheet</a> (PDF).
  <hr />


  <h2 id="edit_dump_file">5. Edit Tag Dump File</h2>
    The tag editor is a simple hex-editor with some highlighting.
    This editor can be accessed by two different ways:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>Read a tag</i><br />
        After reading a tag the result is displayed in this
        editor (See chapter <a href="#read_tag">Read Tag</a>.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Open a saved tag</i><br />
        You can edit a saved dump via &quot;Edit Tag Dump&quot; from
        main menu.
      </li>
    </ul>
    You can save a dump into a file by pressing the save toolbar button
    (or menu item). The dumps will be saved in the
    <b>MifareClassicTool/dump-files/</b> directory (on external storage).

  <h3 id="share_dump">5.1 Share a Dump</h3>
    From the dump editor you can share a dump (via toolbar or menu item).
    You can choose between Apps that are willing to process the dump file.
    Note that some Apps fail to process the dump.<br />
    Apps which are known to work with MCT: Gmail, Bluetooth, etc.

  <h3 id="display_ascii">5.2 Display Data as ASCII</h3>
    From the dump editor you can display the data in 7-Bit US-ASCII (via menu).
    Non printable characters are replaced with a dot (".").
    The last block of a sector, the sector trailer, will not be
    translated to ASCII.

  <h3 id="display_ac">5.3 Display Access Conditions</h3>
    From the dump editor you can display the Mifare Classic Access
    Conditions as a table (via the menu). If you do not know what they are,
    you can read chapter 8.6.3 and 8.7 (and subchapters) from the
    <a href="http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/MF1S50YYX.pdf">
    Mifare Classic (1k) Datasheet</a> (PDF).

  <h3 id="display_vb">5.4 Display Value Blocks as Integers</h3>
    From the dump editor you can decode blocks formatted as
    Mifare Classic Value Block to integer format (via the menu).
    For further information regarding Value Blocks read/see
    chapter 8.6.2.1 from the
    <a href="http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/MF1S50YYX.pdf">
    Mifare Classic (1k) Datasheet</a> (PDF).

  <h3 id="display_manuf_date">5.5 Display the date of manufacture</h3>
    From the dump editor you can decode the date of manufacture (via the menu).
    <br /><br />
    The last 2 bytes of the manufacturer block (sector 0, block 0) are
    representing the date of manufacture. They should be in binary
    coded decimal format (BCD, only digits, no letters). The first byte
    represents the week of manufacture and must be between 1 and 53.
    The second byte represents the year of manufacture and must be between 0
    and the current year (e.g. 12, meaning 2012).
    <br /><br />
    This is not a standard. Some manufacturers don't stick to this.
    So it is possible that MCT can't display the date of manufacture
    or display a wrong one.

  <h3 id="write_dump_from_editor">5.6 Write Dump</h3>
    You can write dumps directly from the dump editor. For writing dumps
    see <a href="#write_dump">Write Dump (Clone)</a>

  <h3 id="compare_dump_from_editor">5.7 Compare Dump</h3>
    You can compare the current dump to another dump directly from the
    dump editor. For comparing dumps see
    <a href="#diff_tool">Diff Tool (Compare Dumps)</a>

  <h3 id="save_keys">5.8 Save Keys</h3>
    You can save the keys of the currently viewed tag into a key file.
    This could be used to speed up the mapping process for the corresponding tag
    because the new key file will only contain valid keys.
  <hr />


  <h2 id="edit_key_file">6. Edit or Add Key File</h2>
    There are two ways to create a key file:
    <ul>
      <li><i>This Application</i><br />
        You can create a new key file via
        &quot;Edit/Add Key File&quot; from main menu.
      </li>
      <li><i>On your Computer</i><br />
        You can create a simple text file on your computer and
        transmit it to <b>MifareClassicTool/key-files/</b> on the phone's
        external storage.
      </li>
    </ul>
    Key files are simple text files which contain one Mifare Classic
    key per line (hexadecimal, 6 bytes, 12 characters).
    Lines <b>starting</b> with # as well as empty lines are
    ignored.
    <br /><br />
    You can edit key files any time you want with
    &quot;Edit/Add Key File&quot; from main menu.
    <br /><br />
    Because key files are used like dictionaries in dictionary-attacks,
    it is sufficient to enter only different keys (even if the key
    is used for multiple sectors). You can remove duplicates
    in a key file (via menu) from the key editor. Also it is possible to
    share key files like dump files (see chapter
    <a href="#share_dump">Share a Dump</a>).
    <br /><br />
    For other advantages see chapter
    <a href="#getting_started">Getting Started</a>, section
    &quot;Advantages of the key files concept&quot;.
  <hr />


  <h2 id="tools">7. Tools</h2>
    This section provides some general tools to work with Mifare Classic.

  <h3 id="tag_info_tool">7.1 Display Tag Info</h3>
    In this view you can see some generic information
    (like UID, ATQA, SAK, Tag size, etc.) about the RFID-Tag.
    <br /><br />
    If your device does not support Mifare Classic, this is the
    only thing you can do with this App. :(
    <br /><br />
    <b>Tag type and manufacturer identification:</b><br />
    The identification mechanism is based on
    <a href="http://nfc-tools.org/index.php?title=ISO14443A">this website</a>.
    If you want to have a closer look at Mifare tag identification read
    the <a href="http://www.nxp.com/documents/application_note/AN10833.pdf">
    NXP MIFARE Type Identification Procedure</a> (PDF). Another
    <a href="http://ludovic.rousseau.free.fr/softwares/pcsc-tools/smartcard_list.txt">
    helpful file</a> for ATS (ATR) based identification is provided
    by the PCSC project.
    <br /><br />
    The tag type and manufacturer determined by MCT could be wrong for
    several reasons:
    <ul>
      <li>The Tag has a customized ATS</li>
      <li>There are multiple tags in the reader field</li>
    </ul>

  <h3 id="value_block_tool">7.2 Value Block Decoder/Encoder</h3>
    This tool is capable of decoding Mifare Classic Blocks into integer
    and the other way around (encode integer to a Mifare Classic Value Block).
