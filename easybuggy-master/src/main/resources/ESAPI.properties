# ESAPI is designed to be easily extensible. You can use the reference implementation
# or implement your own providers to take advantage of your enterprise's security
# infrastructure. The functions in ESAPI are referenced using the ESAPI locator, like:
#
#    String ciphertext =
#		ESAPI.encryptor().encrypt("Secret message");   // Deprecated in 2.0
#    CipherText cipherText =
#		ESAPI.encryptor().encrypt(new PlainText("Secret message")); // Preferred
#
# Below you can specify the classname for the provider that you wish to use in your
# application. The only requirement is that it implement the appropriate ESAPI interface.
# This allows you to switch security implementations in the future without rewriting the
# entire application.

#===========================================================================
# ESAPI Encoder
#
# ESAPI canonicalizes input before validation to prevent bypassing filters with encoded attacks.
# Failure to canonicalize input is a very common mistake when implementing validation schemes.
# Canonicalization is automatic when using the ESAPI Validator, but you can also use the
# following code to canonicalize data.
#
#      ESAPI.Encoder().canonicalize( "%22hello world&#x22;" );
#  
# Multiple encoding is when a single encoding format is applied multiple times. Allowing
# multiple encoding is strongly discouraged.
Encoder.AllowMultipleEncoding=false

# Mixed encoding is when multiple different encoding formats are applied, or when 
# multiple formats are nested. Allowing multiple encoding is strongly discouraged.
Encoder.AllowMixedEncoding=false

# The default list of codecs to apply when canonicalizing untrusted data. The list should include the codecs
# for all downstream interpreters or decoders. For example, if the data is likely to end up in a URL, HTML, or
# inside JavaScript, then the list of codecs below is appropriate. The order of the list is not terribly important.
